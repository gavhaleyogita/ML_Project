Airbnb house price Prediction and Customer churn prediction
Predicting Airbnb Listing Prices- Collected and prepared data
 from Airbnb listings, engineered new features, and implemented
 regression techniques to develop a predictive model for
 estimating property prices. Also, utilized python libraries
 (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for data manipulation, feature
 engineering, and model evaluation. Customer Churn Prediction in
 Telecom Industry- Built a classification model to predict
 customer churn using machine learning algorithms like Logistic
 Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. and
 conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), and evaluated model
 performance with accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
